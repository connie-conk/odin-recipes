            <h3>The most delicious prime ribbly</h3>
            <p> A full rack of prime beef is 7 ribs, which will easily serve 14 to 16 people (or more!). A full rack will not fit in my oven, so when I'm feeding a crowd, I cut the roast in half (3 ribs on one roast and 4 ribs on the other) and cook them in separate ovens.</p>

             <p> As for estimating how big a roast you'll need, the butchers I've talked to say to estimate 2 people for every rib. In my experience, that's a LOT of meat! </p>
